For this assignment I had a LOT of internet help.
Here are some of the sites that helped me:

http://www.cplusplus.com/doc/tutorial/files/

    -this one helped with with file input and output

https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/command-line-arguments-in-c-cpp/

    -this helped me with command line arguments in c++

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/41456245/is-it-possible-to-iterate-through-a-text-file-lines-and-use-stringstream-to-pars

    -i used this website to help with how to iterate through the lines when reading from a file

This assignment definitely was a challenge for me but its finally done.
